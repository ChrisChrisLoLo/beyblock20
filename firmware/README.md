# Firmware

## Requirements
You want to flash CircuitPython 8.0.0 or later on your boards.
For now this might even mean using the beta version.

## Installation
Run `./upload.sh bc` or `./upload.sh bp` depending on if you want to upload the beyblock20 controller (`bc`) firmware, or the beyblock20 peripheral firmware(`bp`) firmware. knoblin3 firmware is still WIP.
